Not entirely useless. Pretty useful, practically for accessing multiple pages of search results.
Change the value of pages= number of search result pages you want to scrape in the  scrape_amazon() function and viola, mon ami, you're good to go.
The deployed site only does for the first 3 pages.
I've attached a simpler script to run directly in Jupyter or Collab for quick use.
